                        <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo">Aleppo </a>
                        is a Syrian city at the northwest part of the country, it's 310 km (193 miles) away from the capital Damascus, Aleppo
                        was the largest Syrian city (before the civil war) with an official population more than 4.6 million (2004 estimates).

                        The original ancient name *Halab* has survived as the current Arabic name of the city, However, the term Ḥalab has been derived from "milk" related to a folktale of Abraham PBUH who milked his sheep to feed the poor.

                        Aleppo is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world so far as it was the capital of Yamhad Kingdom and several
                        successive civilizations such as Aramaic, Assyrian, Persian, Romanian, Byzantine, at last till today the Islamic, in the Abbasid era,
                        Aleppo emerged as the capital of the Hamdanid Dynasty state, which spread from Aleppo to the Upper Mesopotamia and
                        Mosul. Its historical significance belongs to being at the end of the Silk Road passing through Central Asia and
                        Mesopotamia into Europe at North and Egypt and Africa at South, The importance of Aleppo began to decline slowly when the&nbsp;trade way shifted to the sea when the Suez Canal was initiated in 1869, the greatest blows were at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Ottoman Empire fell after thr world war
                        1, the northern parts of Aleppo (Iskenderun and Antakia) were annexed to Turkey in 1920 by Atatürk and the French
                        Mandate authorities, whereas the Skes-Picot agreement between UK and France has caused the separation of Iraq and Syria which led
                        Aleppo to massive depression and deterioration in the economy,&nbsp;After that, Aleppo's political position declined because Damascus has become the capital of Syria. In spite of all these strikes, this city remained the economic capital of Syria, it contains the most important
                        industrial plants also it's the center of the agricultural areas in Syria, especially the cultivation of cotton
                        necessary for the flourishing textile factories in the city. The old city of Aleppo has become a World Heritage, the
                        city was named the capital of Islamic culture for the Arab world in 2006.</article>

                        <article>
                            <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Aleppo">The Great Mosque</a> of Aleppo is one of the largest and oldest mosques in Aleppo, The mosque is located
                            in the Jaloum neighborhood in the old city and located near to Al-Madenah bazar. It's also known for the presence of
                            remains of the Prophet Zechariah body pbuh (John the Baptist's father).
                            The mosque is built on ​​105 meters in length and about 77.75 meters in width. It is very similar in design and style to
                            its big brother The Great Mosque of Damascus. The minaret was built within 10 years between 1080 and 1090.
                            The mosque was renovated in 1159 by Sultan Nur al-Din Zangi after a major fire had destroyed the mosque earlier, but the
                            mosque was again demolished in 1260 by the Mongols. The Mamluks (1516-1620) carried out several repairs and made several
                            modifications to the mosque, where the minaret was decorated with kufic sculptures and inscriptions instead of
                            traditional decorations, The Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun replaced the burned preaching platform in 1285 AD, The
                            mosque's courtyard and minaret were restored in 2003, but they were destroyed in April 2013 as a result of the
                            battles that erupted there in the events of the Syrian crisis.

                    <h2>المطبخ الحلبي</h2>
                    <article>
                        يتميز المطبخ السوري بشكلٍ عام والمطبخ الحلبي بشكلٍ خاص بتنوع أطباقه, الأطباق السورية غنية بالزيتون,
                        البندق والفستق, وحلب
                        بالذات مشهورة بأطباقها اللذيذة وبحب أهلها للقمة الهنيئة, ويُقال (حلب أرض المحاشي والكبب) أو كما
                        يُقال بين السكان
                        المحليين (حلب ام المحاشي والكبب), لذلك ليس من المفاجئ بأن يفوز مطبخها بجائزة التذوق العالمية من قبل
                        أكاديمية الطهي
                        والتذوق العالمية من فرنسا عام 2007 ولكن في الحقيقة, فإن حلب كانت عاصمةً للطبخ قبل جائزة باريس بكثير,
                        ربما يعود السبب إلى
                        تمازج عديد من الإثنيات فيها, الأمر الذي ساعد على تعدد أنواع الأطباق, نظراً لأنها كانت جزءاً من
                        الدولة العثمانية, فهي
                        تحتوي على الكثير من الأصناف مثل الكباب, الكبة, اليبرق (محشي ورق العنب), محاشي الباذنجان والكوسا,
                        اللحمة بالكرز,
                        السماقية, السفرجلية, يعتبر إفطار الفول المدمس إفطاراً تقليدياً في مدينة حلب, مضافاً إليه الزيت وعصير
                        الليمون والفلفل
                        الأحمر, وتعتبر الكبة أحد اختصاصات المطبخ الحلبي الأثيرة وأكثر أكلة محبوبة من قبل السكان, ابتكر
                        الحلبيون أكثر من 17 نوعاً
                        من أنواع الكبب المشهورة في الديار الشامية.
                        حلب أيضاً مركزُ هام لصناعة الحلويات, والتي تتميز باحتوائها على نسب كبيرة من الزبدة والسكر, مثل
                        المبرومة, سوار الست,
                        البللورية, بالإضافة لأصنافٍ أخرى مثل المامونية, الشعيبيات, المشبك, الزلابية, غزل البنات, وتتضمن معظم
                        هذه الحلويات الجوز
                        والقشطة و‌الفستق الحلبي الشهير.
